# This script exposes some functions which can be imported in order to start/stop/check we have a our environment up.
#
# The scripts are a 'test' resource, as they are not mean to be used in production, but rather only via tests or as
# development tools.
#
# The scripts are invoked from code using 'DockerEnv', which is then used by the 'BaseSpec' to ensure a database
# is running before each test.
#
# Alternatively the scripts (e.g. startDocker.sh, stopDocker.sh) can be used manually by developers if
# they're wanting to ensure an environment is running when starting up processes which run on their dev machine.
